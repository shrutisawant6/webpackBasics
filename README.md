# Basics of Webpack ðŸ“¦

### Why Webpack?
Webpack is a tool that combines all your application files (such as JavaScript, CSS, and images) into a single file. 
- This reduces the number of browser requests,
- eliminates unused code to make the file smaller,
- ensures the correct order of file execution, and
- provides live updates for changes made during development.

> To keep it simple, Webpack is like stuffing all your clothes into one travel case.
